## Things to do in Las Vegas

The best way to get around Las Vegas is by car, either driving, using a
rideshare service, or taxi. There is also a bus system that goes
throughout the Las Vegas Valley operated by the [RTC of Southern
Nevada](https://www.rtcsnv.com/) but it is not very direct
and will add significant time to your travel.

UNLV is located right next to the Las Vegas Strip. There are many
[exciting things to do on the
Strip](https://www.visitlasvegas.com/las-vegas-strip/), but
here are some of our favorite areas to explore around Vegas that are off
the Strip:

[Downtown
Vegas](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Lied+Library,+Las+Vegas,+NV/Downtown,+Las+Vegas,+NV/@36.1382619,-115.1891049,13z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x80c8c5aa88bfbfd1:0x6b36f9bf8527a509!2m2!1d-115.1423505!2d36.1071839!1m5!1m1!1s0x80c8c373a778174d:0xfb08722262eae752!2m2!1d-115.1406108!2d36.1692059!3e0?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDIwOS4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D)
